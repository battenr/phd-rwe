# PhD Project (RWE)

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

Code used for my PhD, in clinical epidemiology, project. The aim of this
project is to determine if Z-drugs (zopiclone, etc.) are really worse
than benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, etc.) with respect to adverse
effects / events.

Currently a work in progress (WIP). This project is still in the
brainstorming phase

## PICOS

The first step of developing a research project is to define the
research question. To assist with this, PICOS criteria can be used to
help refine the research question. For this project, PICOS are as
follows:

  - **P**opulation: Adults, defined as people 18 years of age or older
  - **I**ntervention: Benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam, etc.)
  - **C**omparator: Z-drug (zopiclone, etc.)
  - **O**utcome: Adverse Effect / Event (hip fracture, cognitive
    impairment, etc.)
  - **S**tudy Design: Retrospective, longitudinal study using
    observational data

## Benzodiazepine and Hip Fractures: A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)

Another important step is to determine what variables are associated
with the question of interest and how they are associated with each
other. These variables were selected based upon a review of the
literature and previous work for my MSc, in clinical epidemiology,
project.
