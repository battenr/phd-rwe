# PhD Project (RWE)

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

Code used for my PhD real world evidence (RWE) project. RWE is evidence
derived from real world data (RWD), which can be from a variety of
sources: electronic medical records (EMR), claims data, observational
data, fitness trackers, electronic health records (EHR), etc. The aim of
this project is to determine if Z-drugs (zopiclone, etc.) are really
worse than benzodiazepines (diazepam, lorazepam, etc.) with respect to
adverse effects / events using a retrospective longitudinal study
design.

Currently a work in progress (WIP). This project is still in the
brainstorming phase
